- **Deployment Gas:** ~1,281,523 gas (~4.3% of block limit)

### Gas Costs (Actual Usage)

| Operation | Min Gas | Max Gas | Avg Gas | Notes |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Deployment** | - | - | 1,281,523 | One-time cost |
| **releaseETH** | 65,382 | 82,494 | 75,160 | Per claim |
| **releaseToken** | 90,662 | 120,237 | 105,342 | Per claim (includes SafeERC20) |
| **setPayees** | - | - | 121,312 | Owner reconfiguration |

**Cost Estimates @ 1 gwei:**
- Deploy: ~0.00128 ETH (~$3.20 @ $2,500 ETH)
- Claim ETH: ~0.000075 ETH (~$0.19)
- Claim Token: ~0.000105 ETH (~$0.26)

### Linting
```
⚠️  12 warnings (all gas optimization suggestions)
✅ 0 errors
```
*Warnings are about using custom errors instead of require (gas optimization) - acceptable for deployment*

---

## Production Configuration

### Owner (Multi-sig)
```
0x4E5D3ef790C75682ac4f6d4C1dDCc08b36fC100A
Type: Gnosis Safe Multi-sig
```

### Payees (50/50 Split)
```
Nick:  0xf35B121bA32cBeaA27716abEfFb6B65a55f9B333 (50%)
Ignas: 0x0D5A708B651FeE1DAA0470431c4262ab3e1D0261 (50%)
```

### Network
```
Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
RPC: https://mainnet.base.org
```

---

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections
- ✅ **SafeERC20** - Handles non-standard ERC20 tokens
- ✅ **Reentrancy Guard** - On all release functions
- ✅ **Actual-Sent Accounting** - Deflationary token support
- ✅ **Ownable (2-Step)** - Prevents accidental ownership transfer
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - Rejects duplicate payee addresses
- ✅ **Clean State Requirement** - No funds lost during reconfiguration

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ **Non-upgradeable** - Cannot fix bugs without redeploying
- ⚠️ **No pause** - Funds can always be claimed (by design)
- ⚠️ **Requires full drain** - Owner must wait for all claims before changing payees
- ⚠️ **Not professionally audited** - Use at your own risk

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- ✅ All tests passing (15/15)
- ✅ Contract compiled successfully
- ✅ Gas costs acceptable
- ✅ Production addresses verified
- ✅ Multi-sig owner configured
- [ ] `.env` file configured with:
  - `PRIVATE_KEY` (deployer wallet)
  - `BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org`
  - `BASESCAN_API_KEY` (for verification)
- [ ] Deployer wallet has sufficient ETH (~0.01 ETH for gas)

### Deployment Steps

1. **Test on Testnet (RECOMMENDED)**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy -- --network base-sepolia
   # Test with small amounts
   # Verify all functions work
   ```

2. **Deploy to Mainnet**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:base
   # Save contract address from output
   ```

3. **Verify on Basescan**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network base <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
     "0x4E5D3ef790C75682ac4f6d4C1dDCc08b36fC100A" \
     "[\"0xf35B121bA32cBeaA27716abEfFb6B65a55f9B333\",\"0x0D5A708B651FeE1DAA0470431c4262ab3e1D0261\"]" \
     "[1,1]"
   ```

4. **Initial Testing**
   - Send 0.01 ETH to contract
   - Verify both payees see 0.005 ETH pending
   - Test claim functions
   - Monitor gas costs

5. **Production Use**
   - Set as fee recipient in your systems
   - Monitor first transactions
   - Document contract address
   - Set up alerts/monitoring

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Critical Metrics to Watch
- ✅ Claims processing correctly
- ✅ 50/50 split maintained
- ✅ No failed transactions
- ✅ Gas costs as expected
- ✅ Owner functions working (if needed)

### Emergency Procedures
If issues detected:
1. **Cannot pause** - funds can still be claimed
2. **Cannot upgrade** - must deploy new contract
3. **Contact multi-sig owners** for any owner actions
4. **Document issue** and plan migration if needed

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Contract logic is simple and well-tested
- Using battle-tested OpenZeppelin contracts
- Multi-sig owner reduces risk of unauthorized changes

### Medium Risk
- Not professionally audited
- Non-upgradeable (cannot fix bugs)
- Depends on external tokens behaving correctly

### Mitigation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Start with small amounts
- ✅ Monitor closely initially
- ✅ Multi-sig ownership
- ⚠️ Consider professional audit if handling large amounts (>$10k)

---

## Final Verdict

### ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet** first
2. **Test thoroughly** with testnet funds (24-48 hours)
3. **Deploy to mainnet** when confident
4. **Start with small amounts** (0.1-1 ETH)
5. **Scale gradually** as confidence builds

**For Production Use:**
- ✅ Code quality: Excellent
- ✅ Test coverage: Comprehensive
- ✅ Configuration: Verified
- ✅ Gas costs: Reasonable
- ⚠️ Audit status: Not audited

**Deployment Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM
*(Low for small amounts, Medium for large amounts without audit)*
